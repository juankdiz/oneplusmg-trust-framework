The Cancer Use Case has been the secondary use case to test the 1+MG Infrastructure. Although a work still in progress it has been acknowledged that the architecture largely supports the Cancer Use Case in its current format. 

The expected outcomes from the 1+MG Inititaive for this use case include 

* Aligning cancer centres over signatory countries
* Agree on a minimal oncological dataset and its standards
* Survey the current genomic approaches in clinical practice
* Establishing a Proof of Concept on data exchange (with WP4)

## B1MG Cancer Proof of Concept: In progress

* The objective of the Cancer Proof of Concept follows the same principles as that of the Rare Disease Use Case i.e., define a set of standards, services and components that can support the five 1+MG functionalities and demonstrate these in action - using two actors: Data User and Data Access Committee (DAC).
The scenario was placed in a healthcare context where a patient receives a BRAF-positive metastic melanoma diagnosis via a standard molecular test, has a BRAF biomarker, and starts standard therapy. After the therapy the patient returns and it is found out that the tumour no longer responds to therapy. Tumour sample is then taken, sequenced, and a mutation is found in the gene encoding PTEN protein, preventing the therapy to work.
Driving Questions for the Infrastructure:
    * Was the aquired PTEN resistance mutation novel or previously described in patients with BRAF V600?
    * Are different acquired PTEN mutations identified in patients with BRAF V600E and not responding to therapy?
    * What treatment was used for other patients?

* Proof of Concept “starting point” for Cancer utilised a number of existing GA4GH Standards 
    * Beacon
    * DUO
    * SAM,BAM, CRAM
    * VCF
    * Crypt4gh
    * Htsget,
    * Phenopackets
    * Passports
    * TES & WES
    * And other existing services ( FEGA & Life Science AAI).
