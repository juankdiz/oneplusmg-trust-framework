title: Data governance and ELSI
description: Introduction to data governance and ELSI
---

To improve personalised medicine based on genomic information, the 1+MG initiative aims to give cross-border access to genomic data from 1 million+ EU citizens for research analyses and clinical applications. This effort must meet ethical-legal standards and be socially responsible.

These standards cover a broad range of topics, including but not limited to consent for research, feedback of results, commercialisation of Intellectual Property, and data protection. While often answers have been given for individual genome initiatives, a joint cross-border genome initiative is complicated by overlaps, gaps and conflicts between EU and Member State laws and policies.

To bridge these gaps and to help the 1+MG community navigate the heterogeneous ethical-legal landscapes, the Ethical Legal and Societal Issues (ELSI) team has worked to establish a legal, ethical and socially acceptable framework for secure sharing of genomics data across Europe.

* Legal instruments for the sustainable implementation of the 1+MG genomic infrastructure 
    * Analysis of possible legal instruments that could be used to create the legal framework that the 1+MG infrastructure could build on and their evaluation with respect to suitability for 1+MG needs

## Public Trust & Stakeholder Engagement
* [Stakeholders trust in genomic data sharing landscape analysis](https://zenodo.org/record/6382431) <span class="badge badge-dark">Recommended<i class="fa-solid fa-thumbs-up"></i></span>
    * This scoping report represents a mission-oriented approach to supporting citizens' engagement and public trust in genomic data sharing, scoping out and suggesting possible approaches. It recognises from the outset that the issues of engagement and trust extend beyond the indispensable involvement of citizens to embrace a much wider range of stakeholders whose buy-in will also be essential to success. This review takes account of the B1MG and 1+MG, and aims to offer conceptual and practical steps for building on those achievements to bridge potential and actual benefits to science and society with a specific focus on citizens.

    * Citizen engagement and public trust have been raised as critical components in the B1MG stakeholder forum meetings and country visits. To discuss these components, an online expert workshop was facilitated on January 18, 2023. Lessons learned from various engagement activities were shared under three subthemes: “When an ELSI framework is in place, what is the (additional) role of citizen engagement in fostering data sharing and public trust?”; “How does citizen engagement relate to (interests of) other stakeholders?”; “When and how to engage and at what level?”.
